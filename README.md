# Porting Tools to SCYTHE: An SDK Proof of Concept

Source code accompanying the [SCYTHE Blog post](https://www.scythe.io/library/porting-tools-to-scythe-an-sdk-proof-of-concept). Provides the source code for a Windows Module built using the SCYTHE SDK and Python3 Runtime.

Specifically, we ported the LMO utility by Rob Fuller ([mubix](https://github.com/mubix)), which is the client-side of the [LetMeOutOfYour.net](https://letmeoutofyour.net/) website.

## Note of Thanks

We want to give a massive thank you to Rob Fuller ([@mubix](https://twitter.com/mubix)) for working with us on the creation of this SCYTHE Module and this walkthrough. Rob does amazing work, and we are incredibly grateful for his time and support. Please go check out all the awesome work Rob is doing!
